# Prompt Manager App - Prototype Build Guide

## App Description

Build a **Prompt Management Website** that helps users organize, edit, and polish their AI prompts across different projects. This is a web application where users can create, categorize, and analyze their prompts to improve their effectiveness.

## Core Features

### 1. Prompt Management
- **Add/Edit Prompts**: Create new prompts with title, content, project assignment, and category
- **Project Organization**: Group prompts by different projects or use cases
- **Category System**: Tag prompts with categories for easy filtering and organization
- **Rich Text Editing**: Support for bullet points, numbered lists, and emojis

### 2. Prompt Analysis & Polish
- **Real-time Analysis**: Analyze prompts for readability, word count, character count, and estimated tokens
- **Smart Suggestions**: Get contextual suggestions for improving clarity, specificity, structure, context, and tone
- **Visual Feedback**: See analysis results immediately when you click the analyze button
- **Dynamic Suggestions**: Suggestions change based on the actual content of your prompt

### 3. User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Modal Dialogs**: Clean, modern interface with modal forms for adding/editing
- **Real-time Updates**: See changes immediately without page refreshes
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Easy filtering and search capabilities

### 4. Data Persistence (Initial)
- **Local Storage**: Start with browser local storage for data persistence
- **Fallback Ready**: Design data layer to easily integrate with cloud database later

## User Journey (CUJ)

1. **Landing**: User sees a clean dashboard with their existing prompts, projects, and categories
2. **Create Prompt**: Click "Add Prompt" → Fill out form with title, content, project, category → Get instant analysis and suggestions
3. **Organize**: Create projects and categories to group related prompts together
4. **Polish**: Use the analysis panel to improve prompt quality with AI-powered suggestions
5. **Manage**: Edit, delete, and filter prompts as needed

## Build Prompt

Copy and paste this prompt to your AI assistant:

```
Build a React TypeScript application with Tailwind CSS for a prompt management website. The app should have a main dashboard that displays prompts in cards, with forms for adding/editing prompts, projects, and categories. Include a responsive design that works on all devices. Use modern React patterns with hooks and functional components. Start with localStorage for data persistence to create a fully functional prototype.
```

## Key Components Needed

- Main App component with state management
- PromptCard component for displaying individual prompts
- PromptForm modal for creating/editing prompts
- ProjectForm and CategoryForm modals
- Analysis panel with metrics and suggestions
- Responsive layout with proper mobile support
- Data service layer (initially using localStorage)

## Technical Requirements

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Data Storage**: localStorage (for prototype)

## Success Criteria

The prototype app should:
- Allow users to create, edit, and delete prompts with full CRUD operations
- Provide real-time prompt analysis with actionable suggestions
- Support project and category organization
- Work seamlessly across all devices
- Persist data locally in the browser
- Have a clean, modern interface with modal forms
- Be fully functional as a standalone web application

## Next Steps

Once the prototype is complete, you can enhance it with:
1. Firebase backend integration (see `BUILD_PROMPT_FIREBASE.md`)
2. User authentication
3. Cloud deployment
4. Real-time synchronization
